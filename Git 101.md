# Git - Version Control System
Git is a distributed Version Control System (VCS). 

## Why Git:
* Many open source geospatial projects are developed using Git.
* Common tool to develop software.
* Better project management.
   * No more project1.py, project2.py, project_final, project_final2 etc.
   * Versioning and tracking changes are systematic, hence, easier.
* GitHub
   * Web based hosting service
   * Free and Open Source for Geospatial (FOSS4G) are hosted on GitHub. Some renowned examples include  [QGIS](https://github.com/qgis), [PostGIS](https://github.com/postgis/postgis) and [GeoSever](https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver). Please note how active these projects are.
