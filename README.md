# GMT 456 GIS Programming
This repository contains sample data, information and code about the "GMT 456 GIS Programming" course offered at the Geomatics Engineering Dept. of Hacettepe University, Turkey.

The **aim** of this course is to teach students how to collaborate on a software project involving spatial analysis by using git.   

The **successful students** would: 
* ***Describe*** the Software Design Life Cycle (SDLC) phases,
* ***Document*** the design and requirements of the software project that s/he worked on, 
* ***Demonstrate*** the ability to work as a team for the purpose of developing a new or updating an existing QGIS plugin.

`Pull requests or issues that are meant to increase the quality of the course content will be regarded as a **bonus**. `
