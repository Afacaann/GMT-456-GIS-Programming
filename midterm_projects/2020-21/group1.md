## Graphical User Interface of the Plugin
### Parts of the GUI (Graphical User Interface)
**1 - Line Label:** Line Labels just some string that give us information about other parts of the gui which is means line label does not run any function.

**2 - Line Edit:** Line Edits show us the directory and name of the files which is selected by Push and Tool Buttons.

**3 - Push Button:** Push buttons run the functions and algorithms when it clicked.

**4 - Combo Box:** Combo boxes work for selecting correct options. This correct options like 'only point layer' listed in combo boxes and we can select the which layer we want to use.

**5 - Layout:** Layout limit to frame of the gui so we can't make gui page smaller then selected layout frame.
